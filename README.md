## Image-Understanding_Main

In order to understand the content of of an image or a sequence of images, we have to walk through an image understanding pipeline: The pipeline consists of 
low, intermediate and high level processing of the image.  The low level processing usually involves preprocessing such as noise- and distortion reduction and 
emphasizing  certain important aspects of the image. In the intermediate level, the image is segmented, typically, these segments are blobs, edges, lines, corners,
regions, etc.   The intermediate  information can then be analyzed, based on knowledge of the domain, in order to extract features, classify objects and understand the content.
